Hi, congratulations for making the scholarship interview. You've done the hard part of studying, but don't take this interviews lightly. It looks deceptively easy, but it might be the only thing that differentiate you from other similarly brilliant applicants. I nicknamed it "the million dollar interview". - BC - 

### Talk to seniors

This might seem daunting if you know nobody, but I bet you know some of your seniors. Ask them what university life is like, how is the learning culture, what things shocked them when first coming to university. Their insights will certainly help you get a grasp of what life at the university is like.

You would also want to ask for contacts of _same major_ seniors, to know in more detail about your specific accepted majors.

If you are not satisfied with the major you are accepted in and wished to change major, fret not. NUS is quite flexible on this. Make sure you talk to your seniors and ask their perspective on the major you are going to change to.

### List "probably-asked" questions
Here is a list to get you started: 

1. Tell me about yourself.
2. Why _insert your major here_? 
3. Why NUS?
4. What have you learned about _insert your major here_? What makes you interested in that major?
5. What extracurricular activities have you done?
6. What are the things you want to do in NUS?
7. What are you planning to do after graduation?
8. What contributions will you give to NUS?
9. If you're offered scholarships from both NTU and NUS, which one will you choose? Why?
10. What are your strengths?
11. What are your weaknesses?
12. Why should we choose you?
13. What do you want to ask about NUS?

### Answer the questions above (yourself)

Make sure not to create fake stories. Tell your story, your hope, your aspiration genuinely and honestly. Your interviewer know which of you are lying during the interview.

### Practice makes perfect

Practice, practice, practice. You need to know what you are going to answer by heart. Practice in front of the mirror, practice with your families, ask somebody to be an interviewer for you. 

### On the day

1. Clear out all technical issues before hand. 
2. Dress professionally, be fresh! You wouldn't want to give your interviewer a bad first impression, would you?
3. Relax! It is easy to panic and  nervous before the interview, but it is surely detrimental to your interview performance.
3. Answer questions with **passion**, not like someone who is memorizing answers. Your interviewer can tell the difference!
