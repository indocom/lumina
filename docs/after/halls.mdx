## General Info and Tips

:::info
This section is a **MUST READ** for anyone wanting to stay in hall. It covers commonality among halls. More specific information can be found below
:::

### Duration
Hall residents are entitled to 1 year of stay. If you want to extend your stay, you should gather points by joining CCAs and take leadership roles in committees. **Points differ for each CCAs depending on the hall focus! **

### People / Community
There will never be a peaceful day at hall. Either it is your block event or dinner gathering, someone will jio (“invite”) you for supper or go out for drinks/clubs. Or some people may just gather in rooms and chit-chat or grind for exams together. _Note: it is a hall culture to leave your doors open or unlatched, because we are a very open and family-like community_

:::tip
If you are someone who wants to get a more peaceful, toned down and intellectually-driven community, you may want to consider residential colleges instead. If you just want to focus on studying in university and like having your alone time, then PGPR may be the better place for you.
:::

### Hall Cultures

If you’re into sports, go check out Eusoff or Temasek Hall. If you're into arts / culture, Sheares or Kent Ridge might suit you better. If you want to try hall life but don't wanna miss Indo friends, Raffles Hall has the biggest Indo population compared to other halls

Dining experience might differ _slightly_ from hall to hall due to difference in catering provider. Do check with seniors to confirm!

:::tip

1. **Want an extra meal?** Fret not! Simply ask in your block group chat for an extra matric number! Or, you can also wait up to 9PM and be entitled to get another meal yourself with your matric card <br/><br/>
:warning: Unlike the residential colleges, halls do not allow you to keep your meal credits and reuse them another time.

1. **Want larger meal portions?** Quietest on Friday and Sunday nights, since most Singaporeans will go back to their homes to eat, or eat out. So usually on these nights, they will serve larger portions of dinner. Or, if you’re lucky, can simply ask the meal servers to give you an extra scoop of food.

1. People in the block may come out with trumpets and go on knocking on every door to **call you for dinner, watch out!** , but I guess this is how they maintain their closely-knit “family” vibe with one another. <br/><br/>
:warning: This only applies to Kent Ridge Hall
:::

### Welfare
1. Recess week and reading week (before midterms and exams): Check out for your block lifts, they will sneak in some goodies in a basket! 
1. You will be greeted by a welfare pack on your first days at your hall and also a welcome gift after coming back from a semester. 
1. Along the semester, your hall's welfare committee will treat you to surprise welfare like mala, prata, acai, hotpot… KEEP A LOOKOUT!

#### Events

#### Specific Amenities

1. **Communal Hall** : The communal hall is a large, open space used for pretty much anything and everything. Situated right at the entrance of Raffles Hall, the communal hall boasts a stage, projector and screen and is fully equipped with its own sound system. The large space before the stage is usually lined with dining tables during the semester. However, it also doubles as a space for performances, formal dinners, committee meetings, parties, and many other events.
1. **Upper Lounge** : A large area linking the alumni lounge, conference room, media room, and library, the upper lounge is perfectly suited for interactions and meetings. The actual lounge is comfortably outfitted with articles of furniture, such as sofas and cushy chairs – perfect for taking a nap on. The lounge is fully air-conditioned during the examination period, providing residents' with conducive space for their academic pursuit.
1. **Lower Lounge** : An area slightly smaller than the upper lounge, the lower lounge houses the TV room, a meeting room, and the JCRC room. It also boasts 2 pool tables and a functional, if slightly out of tune, piano. Groups of people can be found there, either clustered around the pool tables, challenging each other to show off their skills, or holding meetings in one of the rooms. Music may waft from the lower lounge as the aspiring pianist, or choir, might practice there.
1. **Hard Court** : A large court that can cater to the needs of various sports – among them basketball, volleyball, netball, and street soccer – the hard court is the place to go for many of RH’s official outdoor events. Our annual Inter Block Games (IBG) are mostly held here, and one can find many passionate sportsmen (and women) from various sports training here, or simply playing for recreation, late into the night – even well past the time when the floodlights are switched off! It is also a common sight to find people playing street soccer here during the weekends.
1. **Band Room** : A cosy, sound-proof space, the band room is furnished with a full complement of music equipment. It is tucked snuggly into a small corner at the front of the communal hall. Complete with a live drum set, several guitars and bass guitars, a piano (the best one in RH thus far), two keyboards, amplifiers, several microphones and music stands, the room is ready to host just about any music practice! Most of the cultural groups practice and perfect their performances here.
1. **Dance Studio** : A large space lined completely with mirrors, the dance studio has a floor that is well-scuffed from the countless shoes of the countless hardworking dancers that use the space tirelessly. Here is where our passionate dancers lose all sense of time as they dance away their troubles and perfect many a stellar performance!
1. **Gymnasium** Complete with equipment of all kinds, built for only one purpose – to build and tone those muscles – the RH gymnasium is a frequent haunt for those who seek to build the perfect body, or to maintain their physical prowess. One will find fit, even muscular, people here, sweating it out to the adrenaline-pumping tunes blaring from the speakers.
1. **Kitchenettes** Each block is endowed with a kitchenette. The kitchenettes are small, cozy places equipped with a range of cooking apparatus – flameless electric stoves, microwave ovens, and toasters – for those among us with culinary inclinations. A common refrigerator can also be found there.

#### Why stay at Eusoff Hall?

> Eusoff hall is located near FASS and Computing, making it really accessible for students from these faculties. Eusoff Hall is also the closest hall to the Kent Ridge Terminal bus stop, making it really accessible (even until past 12 am!). I personally like Eusoff because of its rich culture, especially in sports, where we have won the last 3 consecutive inter-hall games. Our performance arts are equally as competitive, as we have drama, dance, and choir. <br/><br/> We also boast having one of the largest, if not the largest, rooms amongst other Halls and Residential Colleges, making it really spacious and comfortable. <br/><br/><img alt="Eusoff 2" src={useBaseUrl('/img/eusoff/image2.jpg')} /><br/> Usually people are afraid of hall commitment. However, fret not because Eusoff hall people are very friendly and open to international students. And when you do the things you like with the people you like in a hall you love, nothing is too much! - Dominicus Bimaputra -


#### Location

Across Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences (FASS) and School of Computing (SoC), closer to FASS than SoC (about 5 minutes walk)

#### Culture/Focus

Sports! Eusoff Hall takes great pride in being one of the most sports-oriented halls of NUS, winning three consecutive Inter-Hall games.

## [Kent Ridge Hall](http://nus.edu.sg/osa/kentridgehall)

#### Why stay at Kent Ridge Hall?

> If you are someone who wants to get a taste of hall life, enjoys being active with many CCAs (people here join up to 5 or more!), sleeps late and don’t mind people being rowdy or socializing till late nights, then by all means, go for KR. 

#### Location
Across NUS Business School (~3 mins walk)

#### Culture / Focus
KR is a culture hall, so it's known for its dance and music groups. However, one CCA that separates KR from the rest is “Steppers” - its famed Cheerleading team that has won several international competitions.

 _Note: Joining Steppers will give you the most points among other CCAs, but it’s competitive, and they will really toughen you up with practices until 3AM!_ 

#### People / Community

- More than other halls, KR is known for being the most rabak (“lively”), they are a very vibrant and rowdy community. Expect to still hear voices at 3AM in the morning. Sometimes, it can be pretty exhausting to keep up, but if you’re the rowdy type as well, then KR will be a great family for you.

- **Sports** : Badminton, Basketball, Floorball, Frisbee, Handball, Netball, Road Relay, Soccer, Softball, Squash, Steppers, Swimming, Table Tennis, Takraw, Tennis, Tough Rugby, Track, Volleyball
