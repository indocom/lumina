International students are guaranteed on-campus accommodation for the first two years of study, subject to university regulations and housing agreements. There are three types of on-campus accommodations: **halls, residential colleges (RCs), and student residences**. Each type of accommodation is equipped with respective characteristics and specialties.

**Halls** embody a large portion of the lively side of NUS on-campus accommodations. That being said, if you enjoy socializing and participating in CCAs, do consider halls! Different from halls, **RCs** are module-driven. Each RC specializes on different aspects, creating a platform for like-minded individuals to mingle through modules offered in-house.

Meals in halls and RCs are catered, albeit being catered differently.

While halls and RCs encourage interaction between residents, **student residences** are generally more quiet. This suits individuals who would like to focus more on academics.
