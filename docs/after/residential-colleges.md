Residential Colleges are a great way to stay in your first 2 years in NUS. Find out why below!

### Why residential colleges?

- Modern hostels to stay
- Great variety and quality of food eg. Malay, Chinese, Western, Indian, Noodle, Yoghurt (although the rates are pricier)
- RC clubs/activities (equals to hall-based activities but with a more humane schedule) and inter-RC activities.
- Exclusive modules to replace University requirement modules, as part of USP/UTCP.
- For students under USP, they will receive 2 degrees from their own faculties and USP upon graduation.
- 2 years of stay guaranteed with no commitments needed

### Note of caution

:::caution
- UTown modules heavily emphasize on writing essays, might be challenging for students who are not used to academic writing
- Modules are more scientific based, which may not be interesting to some people
- More expensive because of the location (UTown) and newer buildings
- Air conditioner fee is not included in hostel fee
