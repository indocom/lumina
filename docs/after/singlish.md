This list of words and phrases is not exhaustive :)
:::  

**Eh**
What it means: Eh is basically how you address people or get their attention.
Example: You would ask a colleague “Eh, wanna have lunch?” or call a friend to ask “Eh, would you like to gym later?” or even text your brother “Eh, I’m not coming home for dinner tonight.”

**Lah**
What it means: A suffix used to place emphasis on the sentence or word before.
Example: “Don’t worry about it lah!” Or, get used to hearing “Out of stock lah.”

  

**Leh and Lor**
Lah is easy enough to master, but leh and lor? Not so much.
What it means: Use leh when you’re not sure about something – it’s more like a question.

Example:
A: What time does the concert start?
B: I don’t know leh. Aren’t you the one that booked the tickets?

What it means: Lor holds a sense of resignation and finality when used at the end of a sentence. Like there’s nothing to do about it, let’s move on. Think c’est la vie with a sense of ennui. Why are you so sad? Because life happens, lor.

Example: “Like that, lor”

**Chope**

Example: “I’m going to tapao lunch from the hawker centre.”

**Cheem**
What it means: If something has got you dumbfounded, perplexed, bewildered, confused or any synonym related to these words, that thing is cheem.

**Shiok**
What it means: Fantastic, or to convey feelings of satisfaction and pleasure.

Example: “Paiseh – can you lend me some cash?”

**Sian**
