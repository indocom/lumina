### Online Application

A briefing about Tuition Grant will be held on 28 July 2017. You have to indicate in the online form that you wish to apply for the Tuition Grant, you will have to submit an application via MOE’s website from 28 August – 1 September 2017.

An email from the Office of Financial Aid will also be sent to your NUS email account in August with more information on the application of the grant and the signing of its agreement.

For more information on the MOE Tuition Grant, please visit MOE’s website.

### Signing of Agreement
Next is the signing of the agreement. You should be informed of the dates via NUS Mail also.

You will need your two sureties to sign the Tuition Grant Agreement with you on your signing date. However, if they cannot be present in Singapore for the signing, you can have them sign in Indonesia under the presence of a notary public. Just give them the soft copy of the agreement (after you finished the application) on the website, have them sign it then send it back to Singapore.

The instructions for filling the agreement can be found [here](https://tgonline.moe.gov.sg/docs/NPbooklet.pdf).
 
You then only need to bring the signed documents to the signing location, and DONE! Make sure to read and agree to the terms and conditions too.
