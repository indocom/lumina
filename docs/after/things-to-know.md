### Purchasing Laptops, Electronics, Gadgets


The Matric Fair is usually a great place to snag some great bargains for laptops. Great promotions which bundle hardware and software will be available there, mostly for Microsoft Office and Adobe Products. These bundles will also come with the Operating System CD.


If you are quite familiar with Singapore, you have probably heard about Funan Digital LifeMall which is one of the more popular electronic vendors. Sadly, the mall is currently closed and is not going to open until 2019. 


Another viable option is to go to Sim Lim Square. Although Sim Lim Square has more choices than Funan, the prices there can be quite high if you are not adroit at haggling with the vendor. Even so, it is still not advisable to make purchases at SimLim Square as some of the vendors are not official vendors and therefore do not provide warranties on their items. 


Lastly, buying from online stores is also possible, for example [lazada.sg](https://lazada.sg).


### Kedutaan Besar Republik Indonesia (KBRI)
The Indonesian Embassy, also known as Kedutaan Besar Republik Indonesia (KBRI), is located at 7 Chatsworth Road.


To get there from NUS, you can go to Holland Village by the Circle Line MRT and take bus 75. Alight at "Before Grange Road" bus terminal, from which the embassy is within walking distance. For alternative routes of more detailed information on getting to the Indonesian Embassy, you can refer to [gothere.sg](https://www.gothere.sg).


The embassy is the place where you can renew your passport when it is expired. You don't really need to bring your photo with you as they have a photo booth inside, but it is recommended to do so if you have your photo as the photo booth is quite crowded. The KBRI conducts ceremony every year on 17th of August. For the Muslims, the KBRI is also hosting Idul Fitri and Idul Adha prayer every year and also Taraweh and breakfast on Ramadhan.


### Indonesian Restaurant and Foods


Craving for a taste of Indonesian food? Fear not! You can always patronize restaurants in Singapore serving Indonesian food; to name a few, there are J-town cafe, Ayam Penyet Ria, and Minang House. Ayam Penyet Ria and Minang House are located at the Lucky Plaza, serving Ayam Penyet and Padang cuisine respectively. J-town cafe, on the other hand, is located around Orchard Road and serve an assortment of Indonesian dishes like Bakmie, Siomay, and Batagor. The price for the food itself is quite high compared to the NUS canteen but it is worth the nostalgic moment of home.


General Indonesian items like seasoning, sambal, Indomie etc, can be found in Belanja.com and ShengSiong. Belanja.com is located around Orchard and offers a pretty large catalogue of Indonesian items. The nearest ShengSiong store from NUS is located at west coast and Clementi. It sells items like Indomie and Kecap.


### Recreation Around NUS


Bored after grueling hours of study sessions? Want to get out and unwind for a while? Wanna catch the latest movie in the theatre? No problem! There are three big malls near NUS.


Vivo City, the biggest of them all, is only a 20 minute bus ride away. Catch a movie, shop for presents, or just lounge on the rooftop garden to enjoy the sunset. Clementi Town Centre, comprising of the newly built Clementi Mall and the smaller, older cityVibe, is only 15 minutes from NUS whereas the smallest, but not the least important mall, is West Coast Plaza. You can get your fix of Sakae Sushi there. West Coast Plaza is the nearest from NUS, only 10 minutes away.


If you are lazy to go out of NUS but need to restock on snacks and tidbits, don't worry. Nanyang Supermarket, located in PGPR, and Fairprice Express, located in U-Town, is the answer. They might not be as complete as supermarkets outside NUS, but they provide a lot of your daily needs: milk, fruits, bread, even soap and shampoo. There are also 24-hour convenience stores (two Cheers and a 7-Eleven) if you need something late at night.
