NUS would have already submitted an application for your student's pass for you. Once NUS have informed you of your SOLAR Application number, all you need to do is login to ICA's SOLAR system to wrap up the process.

Once you log-in, you need to: 
- Complete eForm 16
- Submit a digital photograph
- Pay a $30 processing fee

Also, do note that you will need to bring the completed (and signed) eForm 16.

Once the application has been approved, you will receive a copy of the In-Principle Approval letter (IPA) via an email. The hardcopy of the IPA letter will be issued at the registration center during the matriculation fair.

This completes the initial process of the student pass application. ICA has arranged for an off-site enrolment for the issuance of Student's Pass on the dates below.
