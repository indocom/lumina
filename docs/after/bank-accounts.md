A Singapore bank account is a must-have for NUS students. Other than simplifying daily payments and savings, this bank account can be used as a channel for paying tuition fees and receiving financial aid or scholarship funds. 

The two most common banks among PINUSians are DBS and OCBC. Both are recommended.

You can check on the banks' websites regarding their account application procedure.

Usually you will need to have your **passport**, **Student's pass**, and **NUS offer letter** on hand when you open your bank account. Perhaps, you also need to bring **a proof letter from respective hostel** that provides information that you are indeed a resident in NUS. Please check again with the bank.
