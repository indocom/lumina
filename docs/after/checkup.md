We strongly encourage you to conduct your medical examination in NUS to avoid any unwanted complications and incompatibilities that can arise if you complete the test in Indonesia. Please **do not delay** in taking this test because you will need it for the issuance of Student Pass.

For the latest information, please refer [here](https://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/general-health/medical-examination/pre-admission/pre-admission-medical-exam)

### Booking 
Early booking is essential to get the date you want! [Book your appointment here](https://www.gevme.com/nus---pre-admission-medical-examination-2021). It will cost $55 (fifty-five Singapore dollars) for you to get the test done here.

### Things to prepare
Several things to take note: 
- Bring your documents and items required for the medical checkup. 
- Your passport
- Medical history/reports written in English (if any)
- Cash or NETS card
- [NUS Medical Examination Form](https://www.nus.edu.sg/uhc/docs/default-source/default-document-library/undergraduate.pdf?sfvrsn=62ea6b98_2) with **Part I completed**
- Prescription eyewear / contact lens
- Wear a plain t-shirt or blouse (but if you don’t have one, it’s okay, usually they’ll ask you to wear their disposable X-ray gown anyway).
- **For girls**, please do the medical examination at least 5 to 7 days after the end of your period, since there will be a urine test. However, if that’s not possible they usually allow you to take the urine test some other time.

:::note
The medical examination will be at the University Health Centre (UHC), NUS (_it’s not in NUH :)_)
